One of my go-to recipes is really easy, and delicious. Even my picky wife, who does practically all the cooking, likes it. It’s the corn pudding recipe that uses Jiffy corn muffin mix, eggs, milk, yogurt or sour cream, sweet corn, creamed corn, and bread crumbs. You can find many recipes for it on line. Basically, you mix all the ingredients, pour them in a square, oiled glass baking dish, and bake until slightly brown.
